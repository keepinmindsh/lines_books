# About the Way Python Loads Modules

- https://www.pythonanywhere.com/forums/topic/14939/

As described in the PythonAnywhere forum post, the issue stemmed from the way Python searches for modules. Specifically, jwt.encode needed to be accessed via pyjwt, but during the loading process, Python would locate jwt first, causing jwt.encode to fail. To resolve this, I forcefully uninstalled the jwt version, updated the requirement.txt file, and redeployed. This allowed the application to work correctly.

```shell
poetry run pip uninstall jwt
poetry add pyjwt==2.9.0
poetry run pip uninstall jwt
```

After completing these steps, I removed jwt from requirement.txt.

In AWS Lambda, I replaced the Layer containing the jwt package using Terraform code.
